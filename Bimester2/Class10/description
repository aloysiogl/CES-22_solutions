This is an example of chat server. There are two programs the server and the client.

To run everything run the script: run_server_and_clients.sh

In the script it is assumed that to access python3 you use python3 command. If your python3 is installed under the name python,
just make this change in the script.

The script launches two clients and one server and the clients are able to talk to each other.
